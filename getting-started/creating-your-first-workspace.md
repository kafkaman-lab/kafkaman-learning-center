# Installation and updates

<br />

Kafkaman workspaces enable you to organize and work together on Kafka projects with your team. Within each workspace you can share [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/) and other components of your work in kafkaman.

When you first open kafkaman, you will be prompted to create a workspace. You can create more workspaces for your personal use and to work with teammates. To create teammates workspaces, you need to sign in to your [kafkaman account](/docs/getting-started/kafkaman-account/).

To create a new workspace:

1. Select **Workspaces** in the upper. Select **Create Workspace** to add a new workspace. You can also search for existing workspaces using the search bar or select one from the dropdown list.

1. Enter a **Name** and optional **Summary** for your workspace.
1. Choose the workspace's visibility:
    * A **Personal** workspace is visible only to you.
    * A **Private** workspace is visible to you and to any team members you invite to join it.
    * A **Team** workspace is visible to everyone on your team.
    * A **Public** workspace is visible to all kafkaman users.
1. Select **Create Workspace**.

kafkaman will switch to your new workspace when you create it. You can move between workspaces at any time by selecting from the dropdown **Workspaces** list in the upper.
